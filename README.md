# Wikipedia search engine
## Summery:
This project is our final project in the "Information Retrieval" course.
We have built a search engine for all the information in the English Wikipedia.
We built indexes that contained all the information and ran them in a GCP work environment.
Some of the attachments files in Git are for building the indexes.
Some of the attachments files for running index searches.

## Indexes:
* Index_title
* Index_body
* Index_anchor

## Retrival Methodes:
In our search engine we used different retrieval methods:
* Page View
* Page Rank
* BM-25
* Inverted Index
* TF-IDF
* cosine simularity
* Stemming
